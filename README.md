# Comparative-Analysis-of-Traditional-ML-and-DL-Algorithms-for-Hydroponic-Root-Classification

- In precision agriculture, the accurate classification of plant root images,
particularly distinguishing between hairy and non-hairy roots,
is crucial for monitoring crop health and optimizing hydroponic systems. 
- This research addresses the need for robust machine learning techniques tailored to
root image classification. 
- The central research question explores the optimal machine learning or deep learning algorithm for
precise root image classification. 
- To answer this question, an extensive comparative analysis was conducted, benchmarking
a range of machine learning algorithms and a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) on a standardized dataset of plant root
images. 
- The study contributes to the field by providing insights
into the performance of traditional machine learning models and
highlighting the potential of deep learning with more extensive
datasets.
